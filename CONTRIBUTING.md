### Contributing to WeatherVenue

Like my other repositories, I try to make my projects welcoming to new comers. Whether you are new to open source or to programming in general, this is a nice starter project.

Check [how to contribute page](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)

This project is no exception; Check a walk-through presentation of the code.  
[WALK-THROUGH](https://github.com/bacloud14/WeatherVenue/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING/CONTRIBUTING.pdf) 


Please prefer discussions page before opening a new issue unless it is an obvious bug or enhancement.

https://github.com/bacloud14/WeatherVenue/discussions/33

Please see open issues for a specific issue and do not hesitate to open any new issue (like better code, readability, modularity and best practice, performance, better UI or even functionality enhancements...).

Current priority: 

https://github.com/bacloud14/WeatherVenue/issues/1

Please know that I am not a keen NodeJS developer, but I successfully made this weather application. It is in its early stage and not proper for final service yet.

If you contribute, please consider that I can merge and publish a new release under one channel or another. It will be 100% free although I can add ads to generate some coffee expenses :)

If you want to maintain the project with me; You can alwayse ask.

Please keep it fair if you want to deploy anywhere; Ask for permission.

Sweet coding !
